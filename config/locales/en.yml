# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    presentations:
      explanation: 
        A <i>Presentation</i> is a set of content for the video wall that is meant to be
        displayed together. Create a presentation, and then add content to it. Edit an
        existing presentation to add, remove, or re-organize content.
      slideshow_explanation: 
        A <i>Slideshow</i> is a type of presentation that contains static images and/or video
        that will be displayed according to a <i>Theme</i>.
      foldershow_explanation: 
        A <i>Foldershow</i> is a type of presentation that contains an uploaded folder of your
        custom HTML, CSS, images, and other assets that can utilize the full capabilities of
        the video wall.
      no_presentations: No presentations yet. <a href="%s">Create one?</a>
      panesd_offline: Could not connect to the video wall controller. The system will not function properly in this state.
      presentation_pushed: Presentation pushed successfully
      quota_available: "%{available} of %{total} available."

    themes:
      use_this_theme: Use this theme
      explanation:
        A <i>Theme</i> is a template that controls how a <i>Slideshow</i> presentation
        displays its slides. Authoring new themes requires adhering to specific conventions
        in order for the slides to be displayed properly. If you're just looking to make a
        one-off custom HTML presentation for yourself, you probably want to make a
        <i>Foldershow</i> rather than a Theme.
